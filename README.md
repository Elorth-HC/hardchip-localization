## üìÅ File Structure

The localization files in this repository are **ResX** (Resource Exchange) files. These files contain all the text strings used throughout the game in all languages.

The `src` folder is organized by game areas and features:

- **`src/Areas/`** - Contains game-specific areas like Campaign, ComponentEditor, MainMenu, etc.
  - Example: `src/Areas/Campaign/Texts/` contains terminal texts like `FabricatorTerminalTexts.resx` with translations for different languages (`*.de.resx` for German, `*.es.resx` for Spanish, etc.)
- **`src/Texts/`** - Contains common texts shared across the entire game
  - Example: `CommonTexts.resx` and `CommonHCTexts.resx` with their language variants

Each ResX file follows the naming pattern: `[FileName].[language].resx` (e.g., `FabricatorTerminalTexts.de.resx` for German). The base English files have no language suffix.

**Important:** Please do not move or rename any files. The current structure and file placement is intentional and required for the game to function properly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Tool

For efficient editing and management of these ResX files, I highly recommend using the **ResX Resource Manager** tool:

1. **Download and install** ResX Resource Manager from [here](https://github.com/dotnet/ResXResourceManager)
2. **Open the tool** and navigate to the `src` folder of this repository
3. The tool will automatically detect and organize visually all ResX files for easy editing

If you wish to add an entirely new language, this tool is the way to go. 

## üåç Supported Languages

Currently, Hard Chip supports the following languages:
- **English** (base language)
- **German** (de)
- **Spanish** (es)
- **French** (fr)
- **Russian** (ru)

Thank you for helping make Hard Chip accessible to players worldwide! üéÆ
